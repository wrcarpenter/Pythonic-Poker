# Pythonic Poker
Poker implemented from scratch in pure Python (work in progress).

The main goal is to create and test a poker strategy/algo that can reasonably be implemented by a player at a game table. There are numerous poker algorithms that are highly optimized (think Counter-Factual Regret Minimization) and can routinely beat professional players, but they cannot actually be implemented in a 'real-life' poker game setting. 

Motivations: poker is a game of statistics which is interesting and very simialar to trading (my first job out of college). I want to find a game I can host with friends and something that I can simulate and use to fine-tune object-oriented programming skills.
