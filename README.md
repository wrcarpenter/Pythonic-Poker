# Pythonic Poker
Poker bot implemented in Python (work in progress).

Motivations: poker is a game of statistics which is interesting and very simialar to trading (my first job out of college). I want to find a game I can host with friends and something that I can simulate and use to practice my object-oriented programming skills.
